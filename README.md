# Fast_Fourier_Transform_PowerShell
FFT implemented in PowerShell based on recursive solutions made in python.

The function takes an array of either real or complex numbers.

Needed a way to compute FFTs in C#/POSH, couldn't find solutions and translated a solution from Rosetta Code. This solution is posted there as well.

## Usage:
  ```
  $Input = (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
  FFT($Input)
  ```
